# This example configuration covers detailed configuration for each sampler

# General configuration
[general]
# Sets the socket address for Rezolus to listen on. This is a required parameter
listen = "0.0.0.0:4242"

# Specify the logging level: error, info, debug, trace,
# logging = "info"

# The default interval, in milliseconds, for all samplers
# interval = 1000

# The default window for percentiles in seconds. Samples older than this will
# age-out of the histograms.
# window = 60

# The number of worker threads which are used to run samplers. This should be
# increased if the process is CPU bound and falling behind when running a large
# number of samplers. Individual samplers cannot be running concurrently on
# multiple workers, so increasing this will not help if a particular sampler is
# falling behind due to its interval being too short, but would allow for other
# samplers to run in parallel.
# threads = 1

# Control whether errors during initialization/sampling should be treated as
# critical errors and cause the program to exit. Typically, this would only be
# changed for development/CI purposes.
# fault_tolerant = true

# Specify a suffix that should be appended to counter/gauge readings. This may
# be set to an empty string to remove the suffix entirely.
# reading_suffix = "count"
