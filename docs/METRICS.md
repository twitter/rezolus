# Metrics

Below you will find a list of possible metrics which Rezolus can export as well
as details on their source and meaning. Metrics below may typically be followed
by:
* `/count` - the value of the counter
* `/histogram/(percentile)` - a percentile of a counter's secondly rate or the
  percentile taken from a distribution
* `/maximum/value` - the maximum of a counter's secondly rate or the maximum
  value taken from a distribution
* `/maximum/offset_ms` - the offset into the minute at which the maximum
  occurred

Sampler configurations will refer to the metrics according to their basenames as
used in the descriptions below.
