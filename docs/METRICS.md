# Metrics

Below you will find a list of possible metrics which Rezolus can export as well
as details on their source and meaning. Metrics below may typically be followed
by:
* `/count` - the value of the counter
* `/histogram/(percentile)` - a percentile of a counter's secondly rate or the
  percentile taken from a distribution
* `/maximum/value` - the maximum of a counter's secondly rate or the maximum
  value taken from a distribution
* `/maximum/offset_ms` - the offset into the minute at which the maximum
  occured

## CPU

The following are taken from `/proc/stat`

## eBPF

All of the following subsections are eBPF telemetry

### Scheduler

Captures scheduler telemetry

  nanoseconds that runnable tasks are waiting to be scheduled onto a core

### XFS

Capture filesystem latency for XFS

* `xfs/read` - distribution of latency for read operations in nanoseconds
* `xfs/write` - distribution of latency for write operations in nanoseconds
* `xfs/fsync` - distribution of latency for fsync operations in nanoseconds

## Network

Capture telemetry for network interfaces and protocols. Reads from
`/sys/class/net/...`, `/proc/net/snmp`, and `/proc/net/netstat`

### Interface telemetry:

* `network/receive/bytes` - `rx_bytes` number of bytes received
* `network/receive/errors/crc` - `rx_crc_errors` number of packets with CRC
  error. Specific meaning may vary depending on the MAC layer, but could mean
  there is packet corruption.
* `network/receive/errors/discards_phy` - `rx_discards_phy` number of packets
  dropped due to lack of buffer space on the NIC. Implies the adapter is
  congested and cannot absorb the traffic coming from the network.
* `network/receive/dropped` - `rx_dropped_errors` number of packets dropped and
  not forwarded to the upper layers for packet processing. Exact meaning varies
  with network driver.
* `network/receive/errors/total` - `rx_errors` the number of errors on receive
* `network/reveive/errors/fifo` - `rx_fifo_errors` Indicates number of receive
  FIFO errors seen by this network device. Applies to: `mlx4`
* `network/receive/errors/misses` - `rx_missed_errors` Indicates number of
  packets which have been missed due to lack of capacity in the receive side.
  Applies to: `ixgbe`
* `network/receive/packets` - `rx_packets` the total number of packets received
* `network/transmit/bytes` - `tx_bytes` the number of bytes transmitted
* `network/transmit/errors/discards_phy` - `tx_discards_phy` the number of
  packets dropped due to lack of buffers on transmit. Implies the adapter is
  congested and acnnot absorb the traffic. Applies to: `mlx5`
* `network/transmit/dropped` - `tx_dropped` number of packets dropped on
  transmit
* `network/transmit/errors/total` - `tx_errors` number of errors on transmit
* `network/transmit/errors/fifo` - `tx_fifo_errors` Indicates number of
  transmit FIFO errors seen by this network device. Applies to: `mlx4`
* `network/transmit/packets` - `tx_packets` number of packets transmitted

### TCP Telemetry

* `network/tcp/receive/segments` - `Tcp: InSegs` number of TCP segments
  received
* `network/tcp/transmit/segments` - `Tcp: OutSegs` number of TCP segments sent
* `network/tcp/receive/prune_called` - `TcpExt: PruneCalled` indicates extreme
  memory pressure on the TCP buffers and that the kernel is dropping packets.
  This is very bad.
* `network/tcp/receive/collapsed` - `TcpExt: RcvCollapsed` indicates memory
  pressure on the TCP buffers
* `network/tcp/transmit/retransmits` - `Tcp: RetransSegs` indicates number of
  segments which have been retransmitted

### UDP Telemetry

* `network/udp/receive/datagrams` - `Udp: InDatagrams` indicates number of
  datagrams received
* `network/udp/receive/errors` - `Udp: InErrors` indicates number of errors on
  incoming datagrams
* `network/udp/transmit/datagrams` - `Udp: OutDatagrams` indicates number of
  datagrams transmitted

* `cpu/branch_misses` - number of branch predictions missed
* `cpu/cycles` - number of cycles **may not be accurate with frequency
  scaling**
* `cpu/instructions` - number of instructions retired
* `cpu/reference_cycles` - number of cycles **accurate**

* `cache/dtlb/write/references` - total number of write references to the dTLB
* `cache/dtlb/write/misses` - number of dTLB writes resulting in miss
* `system/page_faults` - number of page faults

## Softnet

This telemetry is gathered from `/proc/net/softnet_stat`

* `softnet/processed` - total number of packets processed by the kernel network
  stack
* `softnet/dropped` - number of packets dropped by the kernel network stack
* `softnet/time_squeezed` - number of times the kernel network stack could not
  complete its work within its working interval. Indicates that the network
  stack is overwhelmed or unable to get sufficient CPU time.
